# Healthify - Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

## Overview

Healthify is a machine learning-based project developed in Python that predicts diseases based on patient symptoms. It incorporates Decision Tree, Random Forest, and Naive Bayes algorithms to enhance accuracy, achieving up to 80% precision.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Sam23599/Healthify
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install numpy pandas pillow opencv-python scikit-learn
    ```

## Usage

1. Run the main file `Healthify.py` to launch the GUI.
2. Enter symptoms for prediction.
3. Click on the respective buttons for prediction based on Decision Tree, Random Forest, or Naive Bayes.
4. View the predicted disease in the GUI.
